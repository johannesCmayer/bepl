# bepl
**bepl** is a video player written in python with speed control that skips silence. Run with `python player.py` in the correct environment (see requirements.txt [pip] or environment.yml [conda]).

If there is silence in the video that part will be played back at a faster rate. This is in addition to a speedup you can set for the non-silent parts in the video.

By default, the player saves the playback position of videos and resumes at the saved position.

This player can read transport stream (ts) files while they are being written and should be able to read all video file formats that are supported by ffmpeg.

The player is very resource-intensive. Performance issues might be resolved by lowering the playback framerate.

Options:
  -s, --speed FLOAT               How fast to playback.  [default: 1.8]
  -b, --silence-speedup INTEGER   How much faster to play silence. This is in
                                  addition to the speedup specified with --speed.
                                  [default: 5]

  -v, --volume FLOAT              Playback volume of audio.  [default: 1]

                                  0]

  --play-from INTEGER             Where to start playback in seconds.
                                  Overwrites loaded playback location.

  --frame-rate INTEGER            The framerate to play the video back at. Low
                                  values improve performance.  [default: 15]

  -r, --init-screen-res INTEGER...
                                  What resolution should the input be
                                  stretched to initially.  [default: 1885,
                                  1012]

  -r, --max-screen-res INTEGER...
                                  The maximum resolution that the screen can
                                  take.  [default: 1920, 1080]

  --no-save-pos                   Disable loading and saving of the playback
                                  position.
